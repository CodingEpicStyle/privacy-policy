# Privacy Policy for Last Time I Did X

**Last Updated:** January 5, 2025

## Overview

Last Time I Did X ("the App") is a universal interval tracker developed by an independent developer. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

**The short version:** Your data stays on your device. We don't have accounts, servers, or access to your personal information.

---

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally (On Your Device Only)

The App stores the following data locally on your device:

- **Task data:** Names, intervals, due dates, completion history, notes, and preferences you create
- **App settings:** Your preferences for notifications, colors, and display options
- **Purchase status:** A record of whether you've purchased the Pro version

This data is stored in a local database on your device. **We cannot access, view, or retrieve this data.** If you uninstall the App, this data is permanently deleted unless you've created a backup.

### Information Collected Automatically

**Crash Reports (via Sentry)**

If the App crashes, we collect anonymous diagnostic information to help fix bugs:

- Device type and operating system version
- App version
- Error stack traces
- General usage patterns leading to the crash

Crash reports are processed by [Sentry](https://sentry.io), a third-party error tracking service. These reports do **not** include your task names, personal notes, or any content you've entered into the App.

**Google Play Services**

If you purchase the Pro version, Google Play processes the transaction. We receive only:

- Confirmation that a purchase was made
- A purchase token to verify your purchase

We do not receive your name, email, payment method, or billing address. See [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for how Google handles purchase data.

## Optional Features

### Google Drive Backup (Pro Feature)

If you enable Google Drive backup:

- You sign in with your Google account directly through Google's secure sign-in
- Backup files are stored in your personal Google Drive in a private app folder
- Backups contain your task data in an unencrypted format
- **We never see or have access to your Google account, credentials, or backup files**

You can delete backups at any time through the App or directly in Google Drive. See [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for how Google handles your Drive data.

### Notifications
